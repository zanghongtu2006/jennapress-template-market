Themes in Jenna Press are equal citizens. Dark, light, and pink should be treated as peers, not as one real theme plus two special cases. That principle matters because hidden priority rules usually create refresh bugs and maintenance confusion.

Language behavior should be equally predictable. English is the default route space, while German and Chinese use explicit locale prefixes. Browser persistence should restore user choice without changing the route model itself.

In short, routing belongs to the framework, content belongs to content files, and persistence should support both without creating surprises.
