bodyTitle: What Jenna Press is trying to prove
---
Jenna Press is built around a simple claim: a project website can stay **fast, multilingual, and maintainable** without growing into a server-dependent platform.

The framework keeps three boundaries clear.

- **Content** lives in markdown.
- **Templates** control presentation.
- **Framework rules** control routing, persistence, and validation.

That separation is the reason the project can remain small while still being practical.
